I'll check in the code as soon as I've finished modifying it

The code will be for <a href="http://holoprinter.blogspot.com/2014/10/simple-hud-electronics-with-arduino-ble.html">this project</a> in my blog.

There are many features that I plan to add to this project as it grows from the simple HUD to something bigger and more robust.

Right now, I've only worked with this on the iPhone 4s; eventually, I'll write a matching Android app.
